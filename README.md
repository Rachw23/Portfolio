# Hi there!

My name is Rachel, and I am a postgraduate student in space data science. 

This is my portfolio repo, where I am keeping some examples of my work developed both professionally and during my studies. All of my projects are written in Python - specifically in Jupyter notebooks here, as I prefer these for presentation purposes.

The projects contained here so far are:

* An excerpt of my work developing a simulation and data analysis of Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTNs) with the Bradford-Renduchintala Centre for Space AI
* A script to analyse NOAA solar weather data to detect and plot solar storm activity
* A short script plotting historical sunspot data from the Solar Influences Data Analysis Center
* A short sample of code analysing publicly available WHO data on public health and the environment
